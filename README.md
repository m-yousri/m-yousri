### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mohammed Yousri.
I had NES since I was 3-ish years old and I fall in love with games, then I had my first computer when I was 6 years old and since then all I care about is how this machine could run these games. So here I'm! a software engineer who loves building anything computer related.

### Me in other worlds
